                        Hey, my name is Ziba Esmaeilian. I'm a design architect  in Los Angeles,
                        
                        <br>
                        I majored in Architecture at Southern California Institute of Architecture and graduated in 2013.
                        Going to Sci-Arch forced me to learn how to research thoroughly, design, and think critically. 
                        Studying Architecture helped me develop visual-spatial literacy and : the ability to understand  the meaning of space.
